Yet another CycleGAN implementation, carefully written by inspecting the [original code](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) by [junyanz](https://github.com/junyanz).

Currently, code asks you to provide some paths with user input, hyperparameters can be set inside the code. Argparse module is not used.

I tested the code with horse2zebra dataset, it provides similar results to the original implementation.

Please note that this is not a **complete** or **standalone** python program to train your CycleGAN models, bug-freenes is not guaranteed yet.

You can start the training your model with `python3 train.py`.

More info will be available soon.
